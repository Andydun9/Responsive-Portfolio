        <p>On my spare time, I enjoy hiking, golfing and hanging out with friends. When I can make it to the snow I also enjoy snowboarding and skiing. I also have picked up the new hobby of brewing beer. My favorite beer that I have brewed so far have been Kolsch. I have also been spending the past 6 months trying to learn to code and build websites. I am currently enrolled in a boot camp to better fine-tune my coding skills.  </p>
